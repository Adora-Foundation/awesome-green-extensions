# awesome-green-extensions contributor guidelines

Hi there! If youâ€™ve found yourself on this page, youâ€™re clearly thinking about contributing to this open source repo â€“ how exciting! A big warm welcome from the team here at the Adora Foundation ðŸ¤—

In this guide weâ€™ll aim to give you all the information you need to make it easy for you  to contribute. If you have any suggestions for how we could improve this guide, come and join the [Adora Foundation slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/adora-foundation/shared_invite/zt-1otudjm68-Hzzl4Cs_BA~HnpGXHfHrhQ) and chat to us in the *#project-awesome-green-extensions* channel.

## an intro to the awesome-green-extensions project

The awesome-green-extensions project is both a research project and a valuable resource for anyone wanting to monitor and reduce the carbon emissions of their browsing.

The extensions and user scripts collected through this project are used as research and development for the Adora Foundation's [Green Mode Extension](https://github.com/Adora-Foundation/green-mode-extension) â€“ an extension that allows you to green all the websites you visit and reduce your environmental footprint while browsing!

Each extension listed here provides a description, browser compatibility information and links (so you can add the extension yourself), extension size, and the last date it was updated (when this info was recorded). Use these extensions for your own research into developing green extensions (the more the merrier after all!) or simply use what exists to make your browsing more environmentally friendly ðŸ’š

## what do I need to know to help?
If you are looking to help with a code contribution, our project uses markdown and a [simple template](#resources). 

If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out the [project issues](https://github.com/Adora-Foundation/awesome-green-extensions/issues) to see what needs to be done. And you can always comment on an issue with a question if it needs more attention.
