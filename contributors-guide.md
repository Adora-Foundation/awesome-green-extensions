# awesome-green-extensions contributor guidelines

Hi there! If youâ€™ve found yourself on this page, youâ€™re clearly thinking about contributing to this open source repo â€“ how exciting! A big warm welcome from the team here at the Adora Foundation ðŸ¤—

In this guide weâ€™ll aim to give you all the information you need to make it easy for you  to contribute. If you have any suggestions for how we could improve this guide, come and join the [Adora Foundation slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/adora-foundation/shared_invite/zt-1otudjm68-Hzzl4Cs_BA~HnpGXHfHrhQ) and chat to us in the *#project-awesome-green-extensions* channel.

## an intro to the awesome-green-extensions project

The awesome-green-extensions project is both a research project and a valuable resource for anyone wanting to monitor and reduce the carbon emissions of their browsing.

The extensions and user scripts collected through this project are used as research and development for the Adora Foundation's [Green Mode Extension](https://github.com/Adora-Foundation/green-mode-extension) â€“ an extension that allows you to green all the websites you visit and reduce your environmental footprint while browsing!

Each extension listed here provides a description, browser compatibility information and links (so you can add the extension yourself), extension size, and the date the extension was last updated (as of when the extension info was last checked by us). Use these extensions for your own research into developing green extensions (the more the merrier after all) or simply use what exists to make your browsing more environmentally friendly ðŸ’š

## what do I need to know to help?

## how do I make a contribution?

Here's a quick rundown of the steps you can take to contribute to this project!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or an extension that you would like to add to the list.
2. [Fork this project repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) . This means that you will have a copy of awesome-green-extensions repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.
3. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine using git clone.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the extension information that you want to add. If you are adding an extension to the list please [follow this template](#resources).
6. Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
7. Use `git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.
9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added information to resolve issue #1111".
11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
14. Woohoo! Your pull request has been merged. Celebrate your success ðŸ¥³ Thank you so much!
