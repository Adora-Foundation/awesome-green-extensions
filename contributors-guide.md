## an intro to the awesome-green-extensions project

The awesome-green-extensions project is both a research project and a valuable resource for anyone wanting to monitor and reduce the carbon emissions of their browsing.

The extensions and user scripts collected through this project are used as eesearch and development for the Adora Foundation's [Green Mode Extension](https://github.com/Adora-Foundation/green-mode-extension) â€“ an extension that allows you to green all the websites you visit and reduce your environmental footprint while browsing!

Each extension listed here provides a description, browser compatibility information and links (so you can add the extension yourself), extension size, and the last date it was updated (when this info was recorded). Use these extensions for your own research into developing green extensions (the more the merrier after all!) or simply use what exists to make your browsing more environmentally friendly ðŸ’š
