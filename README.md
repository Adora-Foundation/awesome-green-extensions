### The Green Web
#### Description
Automatically check the sustainability of a website with The Green Web add-on.
With this extension, you can see the green (or not-so-green) status of a website at glance, based on what kind of energy is used to power the servers it runs on.

*Key features include:*
- Quickly assess whether a site you're browsing is using green power by looking for the green smiley face icon next to your browser.
- If you're on a search page or a page with links to external sites, you can see if the external site is hosted on green servers too because they'll have a green dashed underline underneath them.

The Green Web Foundation maintains an open database listing which datacentres around the world run on green power.  We use this to present this information in this browser extension.

*Open source*
